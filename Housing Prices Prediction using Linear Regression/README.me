# House Prices Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to predict house prices based on various features, such as square footage, overall quality, year built, and more. The project includes steps for data generation, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

# Project Overview
In this project, we:
1. Generated a synthetic dataset to simulate real-world house pricing data.
2. Used Linear Regression to create a predictive model.
3. Evaluated the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.
4. Visualized the results to interpret the model's accuracy and predictive capability.

# Dataset
A synthetic dataset was generated with the following features:

- Lot Area: Lot area in square feet.
- Overall Quality: Overall quality of the house on a scale from 1 to 10.
- Year Built: Year the house was built.
- Total Basement Area: Basement area in square feet.
- Above Ground Living Area: Living area above ground in square feet.
- Full Bathrooms: Number of full bathrooms.
- Garage Cars: Number of cars the garage can hold.
- Garage Area: Garage area in square feet.
The target variable is Sale Price of the house, which is generated with some random noise for realism.

# Conclusion
This project walks through using Linear Regression to predict house prices with custom-generated data, demonstrating data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
