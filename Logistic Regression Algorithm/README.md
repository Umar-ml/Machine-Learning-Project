# Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project uses Logistic Regression to predict customer churn based on various customer and contract characteristics. Through this project, we’ll walk through creating synthetic data, training a logistic regression model, evaluating its performance, visualizing results, and making predictions on new inputs.

Project Overview
In this project, we:
1. Generate a synthetic dataset simulating customer behavior and contract types.
2. Preprocess data for model training.
3. Train a Logistic Regression model and evaluate its performance using key metrics.
4. Visualize model performance through a confusion matrix and actual vs. predicted probabilities.
5. Predict churn for new data points.

Dataset Description
The synthetic dataset includes:
- Monthly Charges: Monthly fees for the customer, ranging from $20 to $120.
- Tenure: Number of months the customer has been with the company (1-72 months).
- Age: Customer’s age (18-80).
- Contract Type: Type of contract - Month-to-month, One year, or Two years.
- Churn: Binary target variable (1 for churn, 0 for no churn).

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates a full end-to-end logistic regression application for predicting customer churn, covering data generation, model training, evaluation, visualization, and predictions on new data. Feel free to clone this repository and try it out with different configurations!
