**Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification Project**

__Project Overview__
This project demonstrates a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier applied to a synthetic dataset, where we aim to predict customer subscription status (subscribed or not subscribed) based on two key features:

Age: Age of the customer
Balance: Account balance of the customer
The project explores the basic principles of SVMs for classification tasks, and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the decision boundary.

Project Contents
Data Generation: A synthetic dataset is generated with realistic patterns, where customers with higher balances and younger ages have a higher likelihood of subscription.

Data Preprocessing:

The dataset is split into training and test sets.
Features are scaled using StandardScaler to optimize SVM model performance.
Model Training:

We train a Linear SVM model using scikit-learn's SVC classifier.
The model is trained on the age and balance features to predict subscribed status.
Evaluation:

Model performance is evaluated on the test set using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Results provide insight into model accuracy and class-wise performance.
Visualization:

The decision boundary for the SVM model is plotted using Matplotlib, illustrating how the classifier distinguishes between subscribed and not subscribed customers.
