# Tennis Play Prediction using Naive Bayes
This project demonstrates a Naive Bayes Classification model to predict if someone would play tennis based on weather conditions. We generate a synthetic dataset with weather attributes, preprocess and train the model, evaluate its performance, visualize results, and make predictions on new data.

# Project Overview
In this project, we:

1. Generate a synthetic dataset simulating weather conditions.
2. Preprocess categorical data for the model.
3. Train a Naive Bayes model and evaluate it using classification metrics.
4. Visualize model performance through a confusion matrix and predicted vs. actual probabilities.
5. Make predictions on new data to determine tennis play likelihood.

# Dataset Description
This synthetic dataset includes:
- Temperature: Weather temperature, categorized as Hot, Mild, or Cool.
- Humidity: Atmospheric moisture level, categorized as High or Normal.
- Outlook: Weather outlook, categorized as Sunny, Overcast, or Rainy.
- PlayTennis: Binary target variable (1 for playing tennis, 0 for not playing).
